# Tic-Tac-Toe

REQUIREMENTS:

The player should be able to click on a square and add an X or an O to the square.
The player should not be able to choose a square that already has an X or an O.
The game should handle automatically switching turns.
X should always go first by default.
The game should alternate between X and O until the game is over.
The game should keep track of the state of the game.
When the game has been won, it should display a message congratulating the winner (X or O) and no further clicks should be allowed.
When a game ends in a tie, it should display a message indicating that a tie has occurred and no further clicks should be allowed.
All possible winning combinations for X and O should be accounted for.
Add a button somewhere that allows the players to play again.
You might accomplish this by causing a page refresh or writing some JavaScript code that resets everything on the page.
You should keep track of wins for both X and O that persist after a page refresh.
You may choose to use local or session storage for this.
